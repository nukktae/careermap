# Gen Z Design Preferences Research

## Gen Z Characteristics (Born 1997-2012)

**Tech-Savvy**: Grew up with smartphones, apps, fast internet always available. Technology is second nature.

**Short Attention Spans**: Like content that gets to the point. Scroll fast and decide quickly. You have a few seconds to grab attention.

**Visually Driven**: Respond better to photos, videos, memes, short clips. Not fans of long paragraphs. TikTok and Instagram feel more natural than blogs or emails.

**Value-Centric**: Care about real issues - authenticity, inclusivity, sustainability. Support brands that reflect these values in real ways.

**Mobile-First**: Phone is go-to screen. If design doesn't work well on mobile, they skip it.
